## Introduction

Welcome to Pac Go! This project is a tutorial to introduce people to the [Go programming language](https://golang.org).

### Why a new tutorial?

We have a lot of great tutorials out there, but the whole idea about this tutorial is to make something different and fun while learning Go. Yes, we need to know about APIs and CRUDs on a daily basis, but while tackling something new, why not making a game instead?

Go is one of the languages that is known for making programming fun again, and what could be more fun than writing a game? Interested? Great, let's move on!

We will be writing a Pac Man clone for the terminal. While writing a game you are exposed to several interesting requirements that make a very good ground for exploring many features of the language, including input, output, functions, pointers, concurrency and a bit of math.

You also learn a bit more about the terminal and its magical escape sequences.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

It's recommended to have:
- Basic understanding on how programming languages work, as we won't be covering the basics
- Basic terminal knowledge (know how to use command line applications)

Of course, if you don't have the above, but is a curious spirit and want to try anyway, please feel free to do so.

### Compatibility Warning - Windows

This tutorial has been tested on both **Linux** and **Mac OS X** environments. For Windows environments we recommend using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

### Setup

In order to start, make sure you have Go installed in your system.

If you don't, please follow the instructions in [golang.org](https://golang.org)

### How to use this tutorial

In every step, we will describe the task in the README.md file followed by the code that does it and an explanation of how it works.

Every step is located in its separate branch except for this one. In order to switch to a given step, execute the following command:

```sh
$ git checkout stepXX
```

Where `stepXX` is the step you want to execute.

When you are ready to start execute in your terminal:

```sh
git checkout step00
```
